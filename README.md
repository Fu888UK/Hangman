##Hangman Game

- A simple Hangman game made with C#. This project was done as part of a mentoring programme. 
- Hangman is where secretly chosen word is selected, and the player needs to guess the correct letters to complete the word.
- Everytime the player guesses a correct letter, this will then populate the empty space with the correct letter.
- Everytime the player guesses a wrong letter, an image of a Hangman will be drawn line by line.
